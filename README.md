**Methods overview:** This repository is an [open  meta-analysis](https://openmetaanalysis.github.io/) that updates a previously published meta-analysis.(1) Newer studies included are listed in the references below. Rationale for newer trials excluded may be listed at the end of the references. 

This respository is a limited review and contains outcomes data only without PICO and Risk of Bias Tables.  This review does not include a GRADE Profile or Summary of Findings Table.

See [methods](http://openmetaanalysis.github.io/methods.html) for details.

**Results:** Details of the studies included are in the:
* [Forest plots](../../tree/master/forest%20plots) ([source data](../../tree/master/data))

The forest plot for the primary outcome is below. Additional [Forest plots](../../tree/master/forest%20plots) of secondary analyses may be available.
